# schnorr-signature
Schnorr signature is a digital signature produced by the Schnorr signature algorithm. Its security is based on the intractability of certain discrete logarithm problems. Written in Java.

Algorithm:

	Key generation (cnt of bits in q on input)
	Signing (make sign for input file path)
	Verifying (check sign for input file path)
